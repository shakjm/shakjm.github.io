This will be my own blog to document my progress in the Deep Learning field for biomedical images. Currently, I'm working on Lung Nodule detection in Computed Tomography (CT) Images in my PhD Research, and wish to be able to contribute more in the biomedical field under the Computer Vision applications. I am currently working on object detection frameworks, which is my main framework being implemented in detecting lung nodules. Previous architecure used was based on segmentation architecture, namely, U-Net model. The base model of U-Net architecture was able to achieve an average accuracy of 70% in detecting lung nodules. Implementation of object detection frameworks have seen an improvement in detection accuracy, which ranges from 85% to 95% accuracy. 

It was an personal achievement, that I was able to develop a base U-Net model for lung nodule detections with an average accuracy of 70%. However, the model developed was poorly done and a change of direction in tackling the research project has to be done. As of May 2020, I am in my second year of PhD, and I am planning to achieve at least one publication before I enter into my third year of PhD. The current framework revolves around 3D imaging and improvements have been made to existing models which has shown great amount of improvement.

Any form of contribution and knowledge sharing, will be greatly appreciated. I am still learning and would be making a lot of mistakes along the way. Some information shared might not be 100% accurate, as it is based on my own understandings. Any form of help to fix these mistakes are welcomed. Enjoy!
