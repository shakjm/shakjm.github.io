# Shak's Blog

This will be my own blog with random updates to document my progress in the Deep Learning field for biomedical images. Currently, I'm working on Lung Nodule detection in Computed Tomography (CT) Images in my PhD Research, and wish to be able to contribute more in the biomedical field under the Computer Vision applications. 

I am on my first year of PhD, and am required to come up with a publication. My current project has been completed until a baseline 2D U-Net model. It might seem as if it's just a simple model, but to be able to code it from scratch, was a big achievement for myself. Results obtained on the 2D U-NET model was satisfactory, given that this is the first time I'm in the Deep Learning field. As for now, I have no plans on continuing on 2D models for lung nodule detection. My supervisor and I will be moving on to 3D Models to be able to consider volumetric spaces or images for better detections.

Any form of contribution and knowledge sharing, will be greatly appreciated. I am still learning and would be making a lot of mistakes along the way. Some information shared might not be 100% accurate, as it is based on my own understandings. Any form of help to fix these mistakes are welcomed. Enjoy!
