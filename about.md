## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/me.JPG" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I am a Second Year PhD student in Electrical & Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University Malaysia. I specialize in Deep Learning on Lung Cancer imaging, but have special interest in Deep Learning in particular. I am more interested in Biomedical Imaging applications in the Computer Vision field. This website serves the purpose as my own portfolio, and also to share some of my knowledge to the public. I wish to become one of the top deep learning practitioners in the biomedical field. I am open to opportunities if there are any that you would like to share with me. I started out in the deep learning field in 2019 with very little knowledge on the field, and was lucky enough to be able to join a PhD program. I've started off reading articles related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning but that did not really help me in my research when I started. It was a struggle and there were times I've wanted to give up. If in any case you were in my position and would like to get some help, please feel free to reach out to me.


### A little motivation goes a long way

  I have read this somewhere online, and it stays with me when I feel like giving up.
  Someone once told me the definition of hell. "On the last day of your life, the person you become will meet the person you could've become."
