# About

This will be my own blog to document my progress in the Deep Learning field for biomedical images. Currently, I'm working on Lung Nodule detection in Computed Tomography (CT) Images in my PhD Research, and wish to be able to contribute more in the biomedical field under the Computer Vision applications. I am currently working on object detection frameworks, which is my main framework being implemented in detecting lung nodules. Previous architecure used was based on segmentation architecture, namely, U-Net model. The base model of U-Net architecture was able to achieve an average accuracy of 70% in detecting lung nodules. Implementation of object detection frameworks have seen an improvement in detection accuracy, which ranges from 85% to 95% accuracy.
